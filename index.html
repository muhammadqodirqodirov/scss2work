                        We’re built on a simple mission 
                        and a commitment to doing good
                        along the way. We want to make 
                        it easy for you to discover and
                        brew the world’s best coffee 
                        at home. It all starts at the
                        source. To locate the specific
                        lots we want to purchase, we 
                        travel nearly 60 days a year
                        trying to understand the challenges 
                        and opportunities in each of these 
                        places. We collaborate with exceptional
                        coffee growers and empower a global community 
                        of farmers through with well above fair-trade 
                        benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm 
                        community initiatives, and invest in coffee 
                        plant science. Curating only the finest blends, 
                        we roast each lot to highlight tasting 
                        profiles distinctive to their native growing 
                        region.
